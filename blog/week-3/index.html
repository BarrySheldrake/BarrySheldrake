<p>It was a lovely sunny day on Sunday so we decided to take the children for a walk. Not long after we had set off I noticed a small piece of plastic in the hedge. The hedges have recently been trimmed and as we walked further we began to notice more and more. I think this plastic is always there but unless you are looking for it you don’t particularly notice it. We decided to collect all the plastic we came across (luckily I had some bio-degradable dog bags in my pocket to collect it in!). By the end of our two mile walk you can see we had picked up quite a lot - some of it crisp and chocolate bar packaging but also lots of bigger pieces which were half buried in the ground.  My new pledge is to pick up at least three pieces of plastic everytime I am out walking in the countryside. A report in Science Magazine estimates that 8.3bn tonnes of plastic has been produced to date. Of this, 6.3bn tonnes of plastic is now waste – a majority of which, some 79%, is in landfill or the natural environment. Of this 6.3bn tonnes only 9% is recycled. If everyone made this pledge think what a difference this could make!</p>

<p>As well as collecting rubbish I have also been on a quest to find plastic-free cereal. When I can’t buy from local shops I prefer to support the local Co-op rather than some of the bigger supermarket chains due to their ethical credentials. So rather than buying Weetabix (which I knew was wrapped in paper), I bought the Co-op’s own brand instead. I was horrified when my children opened the box to find that the biscuits were wrapped in plastic. I quickly sent the following email to Customer Services, and am yet to hear a reply! Weetabix reverted back to paper after using film in 2012, not because it was better environmentally, but because it is easier to open. I will stick to Weetabix in the future and begin making my own muesli and granola in the future, watch this space for recipes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/weetabix.jpg" height="48" /></p>

<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>

<p>I am writing to enquire why you wrap your wholewheat biscuits in plastic rather than paper like Weetabix do? I believe you to be an ethical company, one of the reasons why I choose to support you rather than other supermarkets, I am surprised that you do this.</p>

<p>Your ethical policy on sustainable development states that nature cannot stand a progressive build up of societies waste, particularly materials that cannot degrade into harmless substances and that you recognise that this is a minimum requirement for ecological sustainability.</p>

<p>Using non-recyclable, single use plastic seems to go completely against this, particularly when there are other viable alternatives.</p>

<p>I look forward to hearing your reply.</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>E.Sheldrake</p>
