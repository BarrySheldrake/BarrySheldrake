I have always thought of myself as an environmentalist. I grew up on a family farm and conserving wildlife was always at the forefront of our minds. We kept areas of the farm wild just for the benefit of the birds and other animals. We tried to minimise the amount of chemicals we put on the land. I shopped locally, bought second-hand and organic when I could. Growing up we were always encouraged to cook from scratch using natural ingredients to minimise the amount of packaging we used (plus it tastes better too!).  Any packaging or waste we did produce was diligently reused, recycled or composted.

When I left home to go to university I studied Environmental Science with the idea that I would go into the Environmental sector when I got a job. Whilst at University I joined the Green Party and Greenpeace to help spread the word too. I carried on with my life thinking I was doing my bit and that was that. I then went into teaching, wanting to spread my passion for the natural world to the next generation.

However, just before Christmas I watched a documentary film with my family called A Plastic Ocean which totally changed my perspective. It made me realise that although for most of my life I feel like I have been doing my bit to help the environment this really isnâ€™t enough, many of the products I bought were either made of plastic or covered in plastic when you bought it. So I decided to try and do more by avoiding single use plastic altogether. I decided to begin by making a New Year's resolution in January 2018 to actively avoid plastic through the choices I make.

The idea behind my blog is to document my journey and to hopefully encourage others to do the same.  The blog, will hopefully, become a resource for people like me who want to become plastic-free by offering ideas, recipes and practical tips.

Together we can make a difference!

Ellie.
