Week 7 - Plastic-free Family

It has been amazing to see how my plastic-free pledge is not only having a positive effect on me, but also my whole family too. My 10 year-old has been inspired by my efforts to write this amazing poem!

We also now can't go out for a walk without stopping to pick up rubbish. We took a walk along the River Deben in half term and didn't find a single piece of plastic. What a contrast to our walk around Needham Lake! It was very sad to see so much plastic, particularly evident due to the recent hedge trimming, which revealed a lot of previously hidden rubbish. My son also took it upon himself to document the occasion with these pictures (apart from the one of him!). I think you'll agree that one of the plastic bags we found had a rather ironic message on it!

Even the dogs have been helping us!
