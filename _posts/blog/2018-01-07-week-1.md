## Week 1 - Post-Christmas Blues

The first week of myunplasticlife hasn’t been too much of a challenge! Mainly because having just having had Christmas I haven’t felt the need to go shopping. I’m sure hurdles will soon be standing in my way when I begin to run out of supplies. I’m also very lucky to have easy access to the family business - Alder Carr Farm Shop which is also pledging to go plastic free. This means I can easily get many of my staples, in particular fruit and vegetables which in the supermarkets are surrounding in packaging, completely plastic free!
