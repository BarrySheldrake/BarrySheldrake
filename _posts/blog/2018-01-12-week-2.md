## Week 2 - The Trouble with Toothpaste

This week I have been mainly troubled by toothpaste! So my toothpaste tube has finally got to the point of needing replacing. I didn’t really know where to start looking for a plastic-free toothpaste alternative. I wasn’t overly optimistic after a quick google search came up with nothing. In fact one website stated that no-one manufactured metal toothpaste tubes anymore. I wasn’t keen to start making my own so I went to my local town. I walked past Holland and Barrett and thought that would be a good place to try as they sell a lot of alternative products. They did indeed sell a range of eco and organic toothpaste but all in plastic tubes. After trying a few other places I decided to look in a large local supermarket (naming no names!) and was very surprised to find Euthymol Toothpaste in a metal tube. Although it has a plastic lid I thought this was the best next option before I pluck up the courage to make my own!
