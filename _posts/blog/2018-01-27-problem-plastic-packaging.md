As I continue to venture further along my plastic-free journey, although I am finding more and more things covered in plastic packaging, I am also discovering alternatives. This week I had the hard job of trying out a new chocolate brand - Eat Your Hat. Not only is it fair-trade and organic, I was delighted to discover when opening the packet that the wrapper inside is plant based. This means you can actually put it in the compost! And not only this - the chocolate is delicious! I tried the cardamom version, but I am looking forward to trying out all the different flavours. If you are a chocolate lover it is hard to find brands which aren't wrapped in plastic. But don't worry I am up for the challenge of discovering which brands aren't!!!

I have also been delighted to hear that glass-milk bottles are on the rise. I have been buying my milk in returnable glass bottles from Suffolk Farmhouse Cheeses. They run a diary just up the road from me, where you can also buy milk from their vending machine. The cows are also raised in a higher-welfare system. Suffolk Farmhouse Cheeses have just installed a state-of-the-art milking system which gives their cows the freedom to choose when they are milked. So it's better for the environment and better for the cows - win, win!
