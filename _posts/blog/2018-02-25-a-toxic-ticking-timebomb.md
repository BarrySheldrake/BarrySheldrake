BPA, otherwise known as Bisphenol-A, is a chemical which is added to many plastic to make them strong and resilient. It has been added to plastics since the 1950s and is found in all sorts of products from baby bottles to food containers. It is also used to make epoxy resins to put on the inside of cans to stop them corroding.

This is because BPA can be absorbed through skin contact. The chemical leaches out of the plastic and can then be ingested or absorbed through the skin. Due to the wide range of products that contain BPA it is difficult to avoid it altogether.

But how dangerous is BPA? This is still highly debated but BPA is said to mimic the structure of the hormone oestrogen, and therefore interfere with the production of natural hormones. This can lead to all sorts of health problems. Young children and foetuses are particularly at risk as they have underdeveloped systems for detoxifying chemicals.  Research suggests that BPA is linked to cardiovascular problems, type-2 diabetes, breast and prostrate cancer and fetal brain development.

Although the exact risks are still unknown many companies are becoming BPA free and even the European Food Safety Authority to reduce the acceptable daily intake of BPA. So how can I reduce my exposure to BPA? It will be practically impossible to avoid it completely as it is in so many products but there are a number of things you can do to avoid it:

1. Drink only tap water or use a refillable metal bottle
2. Avoid canned foods and buy products in cardboard or glass containers, unless they state they are BPA-free
3. Pack your own lunches using metal containers
4. Eat freshly prepared foods which haven't been wrapped in plastic
5. Use wooden utensils for cooking with
6. Use metal or glass containers for storing left-overs
7. Use a metal percolator or cafeti√®re to make your daily coffee
