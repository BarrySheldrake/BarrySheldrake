**Week 5 - Natural, Plastic-free Toothpaste**

This week I have decided to bite the bullet and try out my own toothpaste recipes (and my new Humble toothbrush!).

I had some initial concerns about not using fluoride so decided to do some research. According to livescience.com the addition of fluoride in toothpaste is to chemically strengthen the teeth, making them more resistant to the breakdown by acids, which leads to cavities. But not everyone needs added fluoride - some people are naturally resistant due to a high fluoride content in their teeth (but if you are or not is hard to tell!).

Fluoride has been added to our drinking water and toothpaste for the last 65 years in which time tooth decay rapidly declined. In the past, 95% of people suffered from cavities! The addition of fluoride is a contentious issue.  Could the addition of fluoride and the decline in tooth decay be a coincidence? I came across many websites that say tooth health has improved as our diet has improved, in fact Public Health England does say that tooth health is worse in areas of deprivation, maybe due to a poor diet. There are also some websites stating links between fluoride and osteoporosis, thyroid problems, endocrine problems and cancers but they do not state the source of their information.  The NHS website highlights some of the health concerns including dental fluorosis, but the in depth reports state no link between water fluoridation and many non-dental indicators such as Down’s syndrome, cancer and cancer.

If you live on a natural diet, not containing too many sugars your teeth will be healthier. But if you are still concerned about not getting enough fluoride, when using a natural toothpaste, there are a number of ways to get the fluoride you need to protect your teeth. You could use fluoride mouthwash, fluoride gel, take a fluoride supplement or even use wooden fluoride dental sticks! Other ways to help protect your teeth - floss daily and avoid sugar!

**Natural, Plastic-free, Toothpaste recipe:**

Mix together 2 tbsp of coconut oil, 2 tbsp baking powder, 1 tsp turmeric (optional), ½ tsp salt and 2 ground cloves. Add a few drops of water to help mix the ingredients and improve the texture. If it is too coarse, you might to run it through a food processor first.  How does it taste? I think savoury toothpaste may take some getting used to! I think next time I will try a more traditional, minty version.

**The best ingredients for natural toothpaste:**

* Coconut oil - can help boost the microbiome in your gut and there is also some evidence that coconut oil can help reduce bacteria which cause cavities.
* Crushed cacao nibs - compounds in cacao beans promote remineralisation just like fluoride.
* Bentonite clay - is a natural polisher, rich in minerals. It’s also alkaline, so it helps reduce acidity in the mouth. It is slightly abrasive so only use once or twice a week.
* Xylitol reduces cavity-causing bacteria in the mouth. Don’t add too much as it is a sweetener.
* Baking soda - it is alkaline and can help neutralise acids in your mouth. It is also not too abrasive.
* Sea salt - naturally alkaline to reduce acidity in the mouth.
* Turmeric - surprisingly, despite it staining everything it comes into contact with, turmeric is a natural tooth whitener!
* Spices or essential oils for flavour.
