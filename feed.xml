&lt;p&gt;This week I have been mainly troubled by toothpaste! So my toothpaste tube has finally got to the point of needing replacing. I didn’t really know where to start looking for a plastic-free toothpaste alternative. I wasn’t overly optimistic after a quick google search came up with nothing. In fact one website stated that no-one manufactured metal toothpaste tubes anymore. I wasn’t keen to start making my own so I went to my local town. I walked past Holland and Barrett and thought that would be a good place to try as they sell a lot of alternative products. They did indeed sell a range of eco and organic toothpaste but all in plastic tubes. After trying a few other places I decided to look in a large local supermarket (naming no names!) and was very surprised to find Euthymol Toothpaste in a metal tube. Although it has a plastic lid I thought this was the best next option before I pluck up the courage to make my own!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first week of myunplasticlife hasn’t been too much of a challenge! Mainly because having just having had Christmas I haven’t felt the need to go shopping. I’m sure hurdles will soon be standing in my way when I begin to run out of supplies. I’m also very lucky to have easy access to the family business - Alder Carr Farm Shop which is also pledging to go plastic free. This means I can easily get many of my staples, in particular fruit and vegetables which in the supermarkets are surrounding in packaging, completely plastic free!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Week 1 - Post-Christmas Blues</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://www.myunplasticlife.co.uk/%7B%22feature%22=%3Enil%7D" /></entry></feed>
