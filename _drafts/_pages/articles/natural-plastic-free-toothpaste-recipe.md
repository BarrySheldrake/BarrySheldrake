**Natural, Plastic-free, Toothpaste recipe:**

  
![](/uploads/2018/02/04/20180204_161334.jpg)

Mix together 2 tbsp of coconut oil, 2 tbsp baking powder, 1 tsp turmeric (optional), ½ tsp salt and 2 ground cloves. Add a few drops of water to help mix the ingredients and improve the texture. If it is too coarse, you might to run it through a food processor first.  How does it taste? I think savoury toothpaste may take some getting used to! I think next time I will try a more traditional, minty version!

**The best ingredients for natural toothpaste:**

* Coconut oil - can help boost the microbiome in your gut and there is also some evidence that coconut oil can help reduce bacteria which cause cavities.
* Crushed cacao nibs - compounds in cacao beans promote remineralisation just like fluoride.
* Bentonite clay - is a natural polisher, rich in minerals. It’s also alkaline, so it helps reduce acidity in the mouth. It is slightly abrasive so only use once or twice a week.
* Xylitol reduces cavity-causing bacteria in the mouth. Don’t add too much as it is a sweetener.
* Baking soda - it is alkaline and can help neutralise acids in your mouth. It is also not too abrasive.
* Seasalt - naturally alkaline
* Turmeric - surprisingly, despite it staining everything it comes into contact with, turmeric is a natural tooth whitener!
* Spices or essential oils for flavour.
