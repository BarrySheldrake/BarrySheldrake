**Massage Candle Recipe**

Such a simple concept, and so easy to make! Completely plastic-free and you'll save money too - I have seen these for sale on the internet for Â£17! The candles are made from pure ingredients which when burnt will melt to body temperature. They can then be rubbed on the skin. A gorgeous candle which is also a lush moisturiser!

**What you need:**

* 1 oz of beeswax
* 1 oz cocoa or shea butter
* 1oz sweet almond or jojoba oil
* 10-20 drops of essential oil
* A jar or tin 
* Pre-waxed wick
* Double boiler - I used a saucepan and a ceramic bowl
* Knife
* Wooden chopstick x 2

I got all my ingredients from [The Soap Kitchen](https://www.thesoapkitchen.co.uk "The Soap Kitchen") but there are lots of places to get all your supplies.

**Method:**

1. Place your wick into your tin or jar, I tied the top to a chopstick to keep it up straight.

2. Cut your wax and butter into small pieces so they melt quickly and evenly.
3. Put your saucepan on the hob with a small amount of water in the bottom. Bring to a simmer and then place your ceramic bowl on top. 
4. Over a medium heat gently stir the wax, butter and almond oil until melted - this will take 2-5 minutes. Don't over heat the mixture or create too many bubbles when you're mixing.

6. Pour the mixture into your jar and leave to cool.

2. Once solid it is ready to use - just cut the wick from the chop stick and you are ready to go!
3. Light the wick and when you have some melted oil, pour it into your hand. You can now use it as a regular massage oil with the added benefit that it is already warm.
