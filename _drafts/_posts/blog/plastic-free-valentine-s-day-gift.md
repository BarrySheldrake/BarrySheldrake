Valentine's Day can be a bit of a minefield for plastic packaging. Traditional gifts, like bunches of flowers and boxes of chocolates tend to be covered in plastic making it difficult to find an alternative. So here is your guide to a totally plastic-free day your loved one will remember!

 1. Treat your loved one to a romantic, candle-lit massage using a home-made massage candle. Sounds complicated? It's really easy - see my articles for how to make your own!
 2. Get crafty - most cards seem to come wrapped in plastic, so to avoid this make your own! There are loads of ideas on pinterest if you need some inspiration.
 3. Go on a romantic walk - the [National Trust](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/lists/top-spots-for-a-sprinkle-of-romance "National Trust Romantic walks") has a great list of the top romantic walks in the UK
 4. Write some romantic IOU vouchers - or [Glitter and Spice](https://glitternspice.com/romantic-and-naughty-printable-love-coupons/ "Glitter and Spice ") have printable ones to save you time.

 6. Cook your Valentine their favourite meal. Seems like a simple idea but who doesn't love being cooked for - as long as you wash up too?!
 7. Dedicate them a song on the radio - get a mention on their favourite radio station, just make sure you send them a link to the broadcast so they don't miss it!
 8. Give them the gift of an experience, there are loads of websites dedicated to finding the perfect experience they will love.
 9. Make them a hamper containing all their favourite goodies - choose a basket or hamper from your local craft shop and then fill it with all their favourite things.
10. Plastic-free flowers - most bouquets come wrapped in plastic, to avoid this buy loose flowers from your local florist and then wrap them yourself at home using brown paper and plastic-free twine. Your Valentine is sure to appreciate the extra effort you have gone to!

Happy Valentine's Day!
